    <h1>Uh oh! No Configuration!</h1>
    <div class="desc" style="padding-top: 20px;">
        No configuration data was found, meaning no opserver sections are configured or available.  <br/><br/>
        See the Readme.txt in the /config directory and .example files for examples of a basic JSON configuration...or you can implement your own provider to get settings from anywhere.
